# WEB 322 Final Project by Omar Khan (132197203)

This is my submission for assignments 3, 4, and 5 of Web322.

**The admin user credentials are:**<br/>
**email**: admin@hoster.ca<br/>
**password**: 123qwe123<br/>

**One sample customer user is:**<br/>
**email**: test@hoster.ca<br/>
**password**: 123qwe123<br/>

### Keep in mind:

-   The admin user can only create a maximum of 6 pricing plans. This is done to keep the page orderly.
-   Similarly, I have capped the number of items that can be added to a plan (that is, the plan features) to a maximum of 13 to be equal to the number of features in the 'Enterprise' plan. Again, this is done to keep things a bit simpler.
-   The admin can change which plan is the most popular
-   On the users' dashboard I have a component that displays all of their prior purchases, so any purchases you complete in the cart will be displayed here in a feed.

Feel free to use the test user but you can also create new customers/users via the registration page.
